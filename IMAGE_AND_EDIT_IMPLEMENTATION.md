  {experience.image_url ? (
    <img
      src={experience.image_url}
      alt={experience.image_alt_text || experience.title}
      className="w-full h-full object-cover"
    />
  ) : (
    <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
      <ImageIcon className="h-8 w-8 text-gray-400" />
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

**Features**:
- ‚úÖ Image display in experience cards
- ‚úÖ Consistent styling with other views

### Clickable Published Status
```tsx
<button
  onClick={() => togglePublished(experience.id, experience.published)}

    experience.published 
      ? 'bg-green-100 text-green-800 hover:bg-green-200' 
      : 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 hover:bg-yellow-200'
  }`}

</button>
```

**Features**:

- ‚úÖ Image upload/change functionality
- ‚úÖ Published status toggle
- ‚úÖ All existing fields editable
- ‚úÖ Form validation and error handling

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Database Queries
All queries already use `select('*')` which includes the new image fields:
- `image_url`: URL of the uploaded image
- `image_alt_text`: Alt text for accessibility

### Image Display Logic
```tsx
{experience.image_url ? (
  <img
    src={experience.image_url}
    alt={experience.image_alt_text || experience.title}
    className="w-full h-full object-cover"
  />
) : (
  <div className="w-full h-full flex items-center justify-center">
    <ImageIcon className="h-8 w-8 text-gray-400" />
  </div>
)}
```

### Published Status Toggle
```tsx
const togglePublished = async (id: string, currentStatus: boolean) => {
  try {
    const { error } = await supabase
      .from('experiences')
      .update({ published: !currentStatus })
      .eq('id', id)

    if (error) throw error

    setExperiences(prev => prev.map(exp => 
      exp.id === id ? { ...exp, published: !currentStatus } : exp
    ))

    toast.success(`Experience ${!currentStatus ? 'published' : 'unpublished'}`)
  } catch (error: any) {
    toast.error(error.message || 'Failed to update experience')
  }
}
```

### If edit page doesn't load:
1. **Check URL**: Verify the experience ID is correct
2. **Check permissions**: Ensure user can access the experience
