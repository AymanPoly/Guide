# üì∏ Image Upload Implementation Guide

## üéØ Overview
This guide shows you how to implement image upload functionality for experiences in your application using Supabase Storage.

## üöÄ Quick Implementation

### Step 1: Update Database Schema
1. Go to your **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor**
2. Run the contents of `supabase/image-upload-schema.sql`
3. This adds image columns and sets up storage bucket

### Step 2: Configure Supabase Storage
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Storage**
2. Verify the `experience-images` bucket was created
3. Check that the bucket is public

### Step 3: Test the Implementation
1. Go to `/host/experiences/new`
2. You should see the new image upload section
3. Try uploading an image

## üõ†Ô∏è What's Been Added

### Experience Cards
- **Image Display**: Shows uploaded images with proper aspect ratio
- **Fallback**: Shows placeholder icon when no image is uploaded
- **Responsive**: Images scale properly on all devices
- **Accessibility**: Uses alt text for screen readers

## üîí Security Features

### Storage Policies
- **Public Read**: Anyone can view experience images
- **Authenticated Upload**: Only authenticated users can upload
- **Owner Control**: Users can only upload/delete their own images
- **File Validation**: Server-side validation of file types and sizes

### File Validation
- **File Type**: Only image files allowed
- **File Size**: Maximum 5MB per image
- **Unique Names**: Prevents filename conflicts
- **Secure URLs**: Generated public URLs for uploaded images

## üß™ Testing the Implementation

### Test 1: Image Upload
1. Go to `/host/experiences/new`
2. Try uploading an image by:
   - Clicking the upload area
   - Dragging and dropping an image
3. Verify the image preview appears
4. Add alt text for accessibility
5. Submit the form

### Test 2: Image Display
1. Create an experience with an image
2. Go to the experiences list
3. Verify the image appears in the experience card
4. Click on the experience to see the full view

### Test 3: Image Removal
1. Edit an experience with an image
2. Click the remove button (X) on the image
3. Verify the image is removed from storage
4. Verify the form updates correctly

### Test 4: Error Handling
1. Try uploading a non-image file
2. Try uploading a file larger than 5MB
3. Verify appropriate error messages appear

## üîß Customization Options

### 1. File Size Limit
Edit the validation in `ImageUpload.tsx`:
```tsx
// Current: 5MB
if (file.size > 5 * 1024 * 1024) {
  toast.error('Image size must be less than 5MB')
  return
}
```

### 2. Allowed File Types
Edit the file type validation:
```tsx
// Current: any image type
if (!file.type.startsWith('image/')) {
  toast.error('Please select an image file')
  return
}

// More specific: only JPG and PNG
const allowedTypes = ['image/jpeg', 'image/png']
if (!allowedTypes.includes(file.type)) {
  toast.error('Please select a JPG or PNG image')
  return
}
```

### 3. Image Dimensions
Add image dimension validation:
```tsx
const validateImageDimensions = (file: File): Promise<boolean> => {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const img = new Image()
    img.onload = () => {
      const { width, height } = img
      // Require minimum dimensions
      resolve(width >= 800 && height >= 600)
    }
    img.src = URL.createObjectURL(file)
  })
}
```

### 4. Multiple Images
To support multiple images, you could:
1. Create an array of image URLs in the database
2. Modify the ImageUpload component to handle multiple files
3. Add image reordering functionality

## üì± Mobile Responsiveness

The ImageUpload component is fully responsive:
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with touch-friendly upload area
- **Tablet**: Optimized spacing and sizing
- **Desktop**: Full drag and drop functionality

## üö® Important Notes

### Storage Considerations
- **Cost**: Supabase Storage has usage-based pricing
- **CDN**: Images are served through Supabase's CDN
- **Backup**: Consider implementing image backup strategies
- **Cleanup**: Implement cleanup for unused images

### Performance
- **Image Optimization**: Consider adding image compression
- **Lazy Loading**: Images are loaded as needed
- **Caching**: Supabase handles image caching automatically

### Accessibility
- **Alt Text**: Always encourage users to add descriptive alt text
- **Screen Readers**: Images are properly labeled for accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Upload area is keyboard accessible

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### If image upload fails:
1. **Check storage bucket**: Verify `experience-images` bucket exists
2. **Check storage policies**: Ensure policies are correctly set
3. **Check file size**: Verify file is under 5MB
4. **Check file type**: Ensure it's an image file
5. **Check console errors**: Look for JavaScript errors

### If images don't display:
1. **Check image URLs**: Verify URLs are correct
2. **Check CORS**: Ensure storage bucket allows cross-origin requests
3. **Check network**: Verify images are loading from Supabase

### If storage policies fail:
```sql
-- Check current policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'objects';

-- Check bucket permissions
SELECT * FROM storage.buckets WHERE id = 'experience-images';
```

## üéØ Next Steps

After implementing image upload, consider:

1. **Image Optimization**: Add automatic image compression
2. **Multiple Images**: Support multiple images per experience
3. **Image Gallery**: Create a gallery view for experience images
4. **Image Editing**: Add basic image editing capabilities
5. **Image Analytics**: Track image usage and performance
6. **Image Backup**: Implement backup strategies for uploaded images
